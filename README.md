# opera-surface-displacement-blog

This is the repository for publishing the informal dist-s1 blog.

- Main blog: https://opera-cal-val.github.io/opera-surface-displacement-blog/
- Test blog: https://opera-cal-val.github.io/opera-surface-displacement-blog/test/

## Installation

- Install `hugo`
  - we used homebrew: `brew install hugo` 
  - can use `mamba` - do not use multiple hugos - otherwise will get tricky
  - great documentation at: https://gohugo.io/documentation/

## Usage

Clone this repo (i.e. `git clone ...`) and then make sure the submodule is correctly installed via `git submodule update --init --recursive --checkout`.
With the repository cloned and the submodule (which manages the hugo theme) correctly pulled, view the site locally with `hugo serve`.

## Contributing

Make a PR to `dev` branch and once merged will publish to the test blog.
When we are ready, we can publish by merging to `main`.
Everything is public, but the test site makes sure things work first.

### Data

It's probably easiest to include data directly in the repository.
See the sample blog posts for examples.

To create a single file capable of multiple zoom layers that can be integrated into leaflet see here: https://github.com/OPERA-Cal-Val/dist-s1-research/blob/dev/marshak/Xc_pmtiles/pm_tiles.ipynb

Note we converted a geotiff with a colorbar to RGB (3 channel) image and then to the pmtile format.
