The NASA OPERA Displacement products from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series of Copernicus Sentinel-1 data (DISP-S1) are available to view in the Displacement portal at the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) data archive site. We post an example of the displacements of landslides on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, a hill at the coast south of Downtown Los Angeles and west of the Port of Los Angeles, California. The south side of Palos Verdes has a large ancient landslide deposit that has largely been reactivated since the 1950's, with a new acceleration in 2023 and 2024 after heavy rainfall.
